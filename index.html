                <p class="bodycopy">Law, like many professions, is becoming increasingly complex.&nbsp; We believe we can do the<br />best job&nbsp;by specialising in certain areas.&nbsp;Our clients come to us for the same reason they<br />would go to see a medical specialist instead of their GP or regular doctor - for specialist<br />advice in relation to a particular problem or request.</p>
                <p class="bodycopy">Both our partners have practical as well as legal experience in our specialty areas.&nbsp;We<br />strongly believe that one of our key strengths which sets us apart from other law firms,<br />is our ability to apply both our legal and practical skills to resolving problems for our clients.</p>
                <p class="bodycopy">We do not compete for legal work outside of our specialist areas, preferring to leave<br />this to the lawyers who focus on those areas.&nbsp; We have good relationships with many<br />of those lawyers and they refer work to us within our specialty areas.&nbsp;One of our<br />philosophies is "do what you do, do well".&nbsp; Other professionals also refer work to us<br />for the same reason.</p>
                <p class="bodycopy">As a firm, we strive to resolve&nbsp;our clients' disputes and solve their problems in a way that<br />takes into account both the legal options and the risks, costs and benefits to them&nbsp;<br />given their business and particular issue.&nbsp; This is the case no matter how simple or how<br />complicated the dispute, problem or concern is.</p>
                <p class="bodycopy">Our approach means that we have to turn our hand to every type of resolution method<br />including negotiations, mediations, arbitrations and court proceedings&nbsp;- and often a combination of those!&nbsp;<br />We are experienced in and are committed to&nbsp;ADR&nbsp;(an example is mediation).&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that in many cases ADR options are the most cost and solution<br />focused way for&nbsp;a client to try and resolve an issue.&nbsp; We are however experienced litigators and can "fight the fight" if that is what is needed to sort things out for the client.</p>
